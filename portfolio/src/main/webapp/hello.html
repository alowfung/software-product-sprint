<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>(Hopefully) a successful "hello" page)</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    
So I'm hoping that by creating a new .html file called "hello",
<br>
the "hello" hyperlink will now work
<p>here is what is previously showed:
    <img src="hello_404_notFound.png" />
</p> 

  </body>
</html>
