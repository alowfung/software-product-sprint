<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Hello page)</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h1>(Hopefully) a successful "hello" page</h1>

    So I'm hoping that by creating a new .html file called "hello",
    <br>
    the "hello" hyperlink will now workhere is what was previously shown:
    <p>
        <img src="/images/hello_404_notFound.png" />
        THIS IS AN IMAGE. NOT THE ERROR ANYMORE
    </p> 

  </body>
</html>
