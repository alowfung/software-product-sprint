    <h1>List of notes</h1>
    <p>Notes/Questions/Comments I had while going through my webpage</p>

    <p>
        Webpage updates in real time only files that have been previously staged and comitted
        <br>
        However, that doesn't apply to unstaged files (a.k.a. have never been staged)
    </p>

    <p>
        ADD HTML TAGS TO .html FILE
    </p>

    <p>
        So I can use "< p > < / p >" for paragraphs, but theoretically I could just write like this w/o tags if I just want single lines.
