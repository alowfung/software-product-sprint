    <h5>2/26/2021</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Webpage updates in real time only files that have been previously staged and comitted, 
            however, that doesn't apply to unstaged files (a.k.a. have never been staged).
             <br>
            Update (3/4/2021): The changes aren't live updating anymore; I have to run <code>mvn package exec:java</code>.
        </li>
        <li>ADD HTML TAGS TO .html FILE</li>
        <li>So I can use "< p > < / p >" for paragraphs, but theoretically I could just write like this w/o tags if I just want single lines.
            <br>
            <strong>ANSWER: </strong>
            That's not a good idea. Web browsers contain a great deal of code to do their best with non-conforming text input but conforming input will
            <ul>
                <li>parse faster</li>
                <li>render correctly on more browsers</li>
                <li>may rank higher in search results</li>
                <li>be possible to consistently interact with from JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>3/4/2021</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>The (empty) <code><hr></code> tag prints a whole line separator by itself if nothing is specified in CSS</li>
        <li>The reason why "output" in < code >< output name="x" >< /output ></code>knows inmediately to print out "x" 
            because it is defined a few lines above as x.value</li>
        <li>
            Still don't know escape sequences (if any) to print out html tags as text
            <strong>ANSWER: </strong>
            <code>\<pre></code> tag
        </li>
        <li>"Outdated" comments are review comments older than the current commit</li>
